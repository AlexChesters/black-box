# flight-tracker
simple flight tracker for [MSFS](https://www.flightsimulator.com/)

# what does it do?
outputs information from a current MSFS flight to a CSV file in `~/Documents/Flight Tracker`

# can I use it?
if you have the PC version of MSFS then yes (although be aware that currently this program is an alpha so don't expect perfection)

1. head to [releases/alpha](https://github.com/AlexChesters/flight-tracker/releases/tag/alpha) to download the executable (`Flight Tracker.exe`)
1. place the executable wherever you'd like (it doesn't need to be on the same drive that MSFS is installed on, but it does need to be on the same PC)
1. run `Flight Tracker.exe` once you've spawned into your aircraft

# development instructions

## dependencies
* `poetry` - 1.1.13
